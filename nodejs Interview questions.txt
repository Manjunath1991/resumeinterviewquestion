-what is nodejs?
 NOde.js is a web applicaiton framework built on chrome javascript Engine v8 engine.
 Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library.
-what do you mean by Asynchronous Api?
 All APIs of Nodejs library are asynhronous that is non-blocking.It essentially means a Node.js based server
 never waits for a ApI to return data. Server moves to next Api after calling it and a notification mechanism 
 of events of Node.js helps server to get response from the previous api calls.
 Nodejs is open source and it is released under MIT license.
-Is NOde a single threaded application?
 Yes Node is a single threaded model with event looping.
-what is REPL in context of Node?
 REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer environment like a window console or unix/
 linux shell wher a command is entered and system responds with an outpu. NODE.js or node comes bundled with a
 REPL environment. It performs the following desired tasks.
 Read - Reads users's input, parse the input into javascript dta-strucure and stores in memory.
 Eval -Takes and evaluates the data structure.
 Print -  Prints the result
 Loop - Loops the above command until user press ctrl-c twice.
-what isthe difference of using var and not using var in REPL while dealing with variables?
 Use variables to store values and print later. if var keyword is not used then value is stored in the variable
 and printed. whereas if var keyword is used then value is tored but not printed. you can use both variables 
 later.
-what is the use of underscore variable in REPL?
 Use _to get the last result.
-what is global installation of dependencies?
 Globally installed packages are stored in <user-directory>/npm directory. such dependencies can be used in cli
 funciton of any node.js but can not be imported using require() in Node application directly.To install a Node
 project globally use -g flag.
-what is local installation of dependencies?
 By default, npm installs nay dependency in the local mode. Here local mode refers to package installation in
 node_modules directory lying in the folder where Node applicaiton is present.Locally deployed packages are
 accessible via require().
-what is the command to check the installed dependencies
 npm Is -g

-> nodejs is the largest eocsystem of open source libraries in the world.
-> nodejs eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.
->nodejs is memory efficient.

->Tooling:It keeeps packages alone from ohter projects, avoiding the version strife
->Streaming Data: It gets high range of data without any discrepancies.
->Highly Scalable: Because it uses event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking
  these application simply output the data in chunks.

-what is NPM in Node.js?
 NPM(node package manager) provides following two main funciton.
 NPM works as an onlin repository for node.js package/modules which are present at <nodejs.org>.
 NPM works as command line utility to install packages, do version management and dependency management of
 Node.js packages.
 
-what are the two types fo API funcitons in Node.js
 blocking and non-blocking
 
-How to scale Node application?
 cloning using cluster module.
 Decomposing the application into smaller services. ie micro services.

-what is streams and types of streams?
 streams are a collection of stat that might not be available all at once and dont have to fit in memory.
 Streams provide chunks of data in a continous manner. It is useful to read a large set of data and process it.
 Readable-read large chunk of data, 
 writeable-write streams are used in writing a large chunk of data to the destination,
 transform-transform stream is the duplex stream which is used in modifying the data(ex-zip creation),
 duplex- duplex streams are both readable and writeable.
 
-what is event loop
 Node.js is single thread but it supports concurrency using events and callbacks. The event loop is a component
 which checks event queue on a periodic basis and pushes the result in execution stack if the stack is empty.

-what is callbakc hell?
 the asynchronous function requires callbacks as a return parameter. When multiple asychronous function are
 chained together then callback hell situation comes up.

-what are error First callbacks in Node.js?
 The error-first callback is a standard protocal for node.js callbacks which has a simple rule that the first
 argument for the callback function shoud be an error object.If the error argument is not null, then the 
 operations was not successful, error has occurred and if teh error argument is null then operation is 
 successful.
 
-what is libuv?
 It is a multiplatform support library wiht a focus on asynchronous i/o .

-what is chainginprocess in node.js
 Its an approach to connect the output of one stream to the input of another stream, thus creating a chain
 of multiple stream operations.

-what are the two arguments that async.queue takes?
 The two arguments that async.queue takes are  1.Task function 2. concurrency value

-what is package.json?
 It is a plain json(javascript object Notaiton) text file which contains all metadata information about Node.js
 Project or applicaiton. This file should be present in the root directory of every Node.js package.Every 
 feature as a separate component.

-what is event-driven programming?
 Event driven progarmming is a prograrmmin paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events 
 like messages from other programs or threads.

-Explain the role of REPL in Node.js?
 REPL(read evaluate print loop) performs the taks of - read, evaluate, print and loop. The REPL in Node.js
 used to execute ad-hoc javascript statements. The REPL shell allows entry to javascript directly into a 
 shell prompt and evaluates teh results. For the purpose of testing,debugging, or experimenting.REPL is very
 critical.
